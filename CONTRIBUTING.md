## How to Contribute

### Pull Requests

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

KFtray uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) to manage the development environment. This ensures all contributors use the same tool versions.

1. **Install mise:**
   ```bash
   curl https://mise.run | sh
   ```

2. **Clone and setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hcavarsan/kftray.git
   cd kftray
   mise install        # Install all required tools
   mise run setup      # Setup system dependencies
   ```

3. **Start developing:**
   ```bash
   mise run dev        # Launch development mode
   ```

The project has an automatic Git pre-commit hook that runs formatting and linting on every commit. Your code will be automatically formatted and checked before committing.

### Available Development Commands

- `mise run dev` - Start development mode
- `mise run build` - Build production app
- `mise run format` - Format all code
- `mise run lint` - Lint with auto-fix
- `mise run test:back` - Run backend tests
- `mise run precommit` - Run all checks (format, lint, test)

Run `mise tasks` to see all available commands.

For detailed build instructions, see [Building from Source](docs/kftray/BUILD.md).
