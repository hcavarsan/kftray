## Features

Using `kftray` comes with the following benefits:

- **Resilient Port Forwarding Connection:** Ensures continuous service even if a pod dies by reconnecting to another running pod automatically.
- **One-Click Multiple Port Forwards:** Set up several port forwarding instances at the same time with a single click, saving time and effort.
- **Independent of Kubectl:** Interfaces directly with the Kubernetes API, eliminating the need for `kubectl` and simplifying port forwarding management.

Stay tuned for more features as we continue to enhance `kftray` for an even better Kubernetes management experience.

## Requirements

- Node.js and pnpm or yarn for building the frontend.
- Rust for backend development.

## Installation
### Building from Source
To build `kftray` from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hcavarsan/kftray.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd kftray
   ```
3. Install Typescript dependencies and build the React application:
   ```bash
   pnpm install # or yarn install
   pnpm run build # or yarn build
   ```
4. Build the Tauri application:
   ```bash
   pnpm run tauri build
   ```

## Usage
After building the application, use the following steps to run the application:
1. Navigate to the `src-tauri/target/release/` directory.
2. Execute the binary for your platform (`kftray.exe` on Windows, `./kftray` on macOS and Linux).
3. The application will appear in the system tray.
4. Click the tray icon to open the UI for starting or stopping Kubernetes port forwarding based on your configurations.

## Configuration
The UI allows you to add, remove, and edit port-forwarding settings with ease. Configurations are saved at $HOME/.kftray/configs.db by default.
