## Features

Using `kftray` comes with the following benefits:

- **Resilient Port Forwarding Connection:** Ensures continuous service even if a pod dies by reconnecting to another running pod automatically.
- **One-Click Multiple Port Forwards:** Set up several port forwarding instances at the same time with a single click, saving time and effort.
- **Independent of Kubectl:** Interfaces directly with the Kubernetes API, eliminating the need for `kubectl` and simplifying port forwarding management.

Stay tuned for more features as we continue to enhance `kftray` for an even better Kubernetes management experience.

## Requirements

- Node.js and pnpm or yarn for building the frontend.
- Rust for backend development.
